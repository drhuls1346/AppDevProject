Web Based Inventory Application Operation Manual
About	
The web based inventory application was written in Python code using Pycharm. It also uses the Django web framework to implement the application on a local computer server so that the application can be ran inside of an internet browser. The application uses an sqlite3 relational data table to store values for the GPS units that are stored in the database. 
Operation
	The methods to input and alter data in the database are not actually functional in this application. If they were completed, interaction with the table would be as simple as going to the home page, selecting the action that you would like to preform on the database, then entering the information that you would like to add or change when prompted and clicking the submit button to send that data to the database. For example, to add a unit into the database, one would go to the home page, click add an item into the inventory database, type in the unit name and type in the boxes that are provided and click submit. Removing an item would be as simple as selecting the unit from a dropdown on the remove item page and clicking submit. 
	Different pages display relevant information to the users. For instance, the home page, the remove item page, and the update item page, conveniently displays all of the units that are in the inventory. The check out page, lists all units that are currently checked in and the check in page lists all units that are currently checked out. 
	As it is, I am not proficient enough with using the form functions in html that are needed to enter and alter information in the database. My solution was to add a link to the top of the home page that will take the user to the admin page where the data table can easily be altered.
